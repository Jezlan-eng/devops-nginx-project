🚀 Day 1 — My DevOps Journey Begins!

I just completed my first DevOps project, where I deployed a simple website using Nginx on Ubuntu (WSL).

This project helped me understand:

1.How to set up Ubuntu on WSL

2.Installing and configuring Nginx

3.Serving a custom HTML page

4.Using Git & GitHub to push my project

5.Basics of system updates, permissions, and file management

🎯 Goal: To complete a 10-day DevOps mini-series — going from manual web deployment → containerized Docker setup → automated CI/CD pipeline.


💡 Next Step (Day 2):
Containerize this Nginx setup using Docker and host it locally.

🔹 Now, About the Timeline and Goals
Phase	Duration	Goal / Outcome
Day 1: Manual Nginx Setup	✅ Completed	Deploy static site manually using Nginx on WSL
Day 2–3: Dockerization	2 days	Run same project in Docker container
Day 4–5: Docker Compose	2 days	Learn multi-container setup (Nginx + app/service)
Day 6–7: GitHub Actions CI/CD	2 days	Automate deployment using GitHub Actions
Day 8–9: Cloud Hosting	2 days	Host containerized project on AWS or Render
Day 10: Final Project Summary	1 day	Post final GitHub project + LinkedIn case study

🕐 Total Duration: ~10 days
🏁 Final Goal:

“Build a fully automated DevOps pipeline — from local deployment to cloud hosting — using Git, Docker, CI/CD, and Nginx.”
